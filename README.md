# CSTextParser
A C# (CS, C Sharp) program that can read-in data from a specified txt file. 
Developed by C. Hans Culton

The file parser reads all lines of a text file and stores them as individual lines. Then, each line is split based off a token, which I have programed to be ":". All data on the right of the token is then saved in a List, and the contents of the list are printed to the console.
